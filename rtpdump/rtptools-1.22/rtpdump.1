.Sh NAME
.Nm rtpdump
.Nd parse and print RTP packets
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl h
.Op Fl F Ar format
.Op Fl f Ar infile
.Op Fl o Ar outfile
.Op Fl t Ar minutes
.Op Fl x Ar bytes
.Oo Ar address Oc Ns / Ns Ar port
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
reads RTP and RTCP packets on the given
.Ar address Ns / Ns Ar port ,
or from standard input by default,
and dumps a processed version to standard output.
The output is suitable as input for
.Xr rtpplay 1
and
.Xr rtpsend 1 .
The IPv4
.Ar address
can be specified in dotted decimal notation or as a hostname
and defaults to 127.0.0.1.
The
.Ar port
number must be given as a decimal numbers between 1 and 65535.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl F Ar format
Write the output in the given
.Ar format ,
which is one of the following:
.Cm dump ,
.Cm header ,
.Cm payload ,
.Cm ascii ,
.Cm hex ,
.Cm rtcp ,
.Cm short .
.Pp
The
.Cm dump
format is a binary format suitable as input for
.Xr rtpplay 1 .
The generated output file should have a
.Pa .rtp
filename extension.
The file starts with
.Pp
.Dl #!rtpplay1.0 address/port\en
.Pp
The version number indicates the file format version,
not the version of RTP tools used to generate the file.
The current file format version is 1.0.
This is followed by one
.Vt RD_hdr_t
header and one
.Vt RD_packet_t
structure for each received packet.
All fields are in network byte order.
The RTP and RTCP packets are recorded as-is.
The structures are as follows:
.Bd -literal
typedef struct {
  struct timeval start; /* start of recording (GMT) */
  uint32_t source;        /* network source (multicast) */
  uint16_t port;          /* UDP port */
} RD_hdr_t;

typedef struct {
  uint16_t length; /* length of original packet, including header */
  uint16_t plen;   /* actual header+payload length for RTP, 0 for RTCP */
  uint32_t offset; /* ms since the start of recording */
} RD_packet_t;
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Cm header
format is like
.Cm dump ,
but does not save the audio/video payload.
The
.Cm payload
format only saves the audio/video payload.
.Pp
The
.Cm ascii
format, which is the default, saves text parsed packets,
suitable for
.Xr rtpsend 1 .
See below for an example.
The
.Cm hex
format is like
.Cm ascii ,
but with a hex dump of the payload.
The
.Cm rtcp
format is like
.Cm ascii ,
but only saves RTCP packets.
.Pp
The
.Cm short
format dumps RTP or VAT data in lines such as
.Pp
.D1 Oo Cm - Oc Ns Ar time timestamp Op Ar seq
.Pp
where
.Sq Cm -
indicates a set marker bit,
.Ar time
is the arrival time,
.Ar timestamp
is the RTP timestamp, and
.Ar seq
is the RTP sequence number (only used for RTP packets).
.It Fl f Ar infile
Read packets from
.Ar infile
instead of from the network or from standard input.
The file must have been recorded using the
.Cm dump
format.
.It Fl h
Print a short usage summary and exit.
.It Fl o Ar outfile
Dump to
.Ar outfile
instead of to standard output.
.It Fl t Ar minutes
Only listen for the first
.Ar minutes .
.It Fl x Ar bytes
Process only the first number of
.Ar bytes
of the payload.
This is only applicable for the
.Cm dump
and
.Cm hex
formats.

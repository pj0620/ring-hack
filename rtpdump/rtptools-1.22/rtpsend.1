.Sh NAME
.Nm rtpsend
.Nd generate RTP packets from textual description
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl ahlv
.Op Fl f Ar infile
.Op Fl s Ar port
.Ar address Ns / Ns Ar port Ns Op / Ns Ar ttl
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
sends a stream of RTP and RTCP packets with configurable parameters.
The packets are sent to the given
.Ar address Ns / Ns Ar port ,
optionally with a time-to-live value of
.Ar ttl .
This is intended to test the RTP features of the receiving end.
.Pp
By default,
.Nm
reads the packets from standard input.
The RTP or RTCP headers are expected in a format written by
.Xr rtpdump 1
.Fl F Cm ascii .
.Pp
Within the input, each entry starts with a time value, in seconds,
relative to the beginning.
The time value must appear at the beginning of a line, without white space.
Within an RTP or RTCP packet description, parameters may appear in any order,
without white space around the equal sign.
Lines are continued with initial white space on the next line.
Comment lines start with
.Sq # .
Strings are enclosed in quotation marks.
RTP and RTCP entries look like this:
.Bd -literal
<time> RTP
   v=<version>
   p=<padding>
   x=<extension>
   m=<marker>
   pt=<payload type>
   ts=<time stamp>

   ext_data=<hex extension data>
   len=<packet size in bytes(including header)>

              (src=<source> cname="..." name="...")
              (src=<source> ...)

            (SR v=<version>
              ssrc=<SSRC of data source>

                (ssrc=<SSRC of source>
                 fraction=<loss fraction>
                 lost=<number lost>
                 last_seq=<last sequence number>
                 jit=<jitter>
                 lsr=<last SR received>

                )
            )

The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a
Include a router alert IP option in RTCP packets.
This is used by the YESSIR resource reservation protoccol.
.It Fl f Ar infile
Read the packets from the given
.Ar infile
instead of standard input.
.It Fl h
Display a short usage summary and exit.
.It Fl l
Send the same sequence of packets again and again.
This only works if the input is read from a regular file
instead of the standard input.
See the
.Fl f
option.
.It Fl s Ar port
Send the packets from the given
.Ar port .
By default,
.Nm
chooses a random port.
